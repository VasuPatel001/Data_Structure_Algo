Cut The Rope
IK DP Test question: https://uplevel.interviewkickstart.com/resource/rc-codingproblem-484808-924352-59-358

Given a rope, cut it into parts maximizing the product of their lengths.
Example
{"n": 4}
Output:
4
Length of the rope is 4.
All ways it can be cut into parts: 1+3, 1+1+2, 1+1+1+1, 2+2, 2+1+1.
Among these, 2+2 cut makes for the greatest product: 2*2=4.

Notes
Return an integer which equals to the maximum possible product of the given ropeâ€™s parts.
Constraints:

2 <= length of the rope <= 94
You have to cut at least once.
Length of the rope, lengths of all parts are all positive integers.
